Team Treehouse Tech Degree Project #1,: Random Quote Generator

Using the basics of Javascript, I was able to build 5 random quotes into objects and store them in an array.

Then using simple random function to pick an array I was able to display the quote when the button was clicked.

For extra credit I did make the background color change with each new quote.
  *with the random color function I built there is a possibility of over 15 million differnt colors to choose from!.

Also for extra credit I did set up a timeInterval function to auto change the quote ever 10 seconds.

There is also a few bonus properties as well.
